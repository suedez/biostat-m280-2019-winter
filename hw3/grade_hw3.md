    Yes, `html`.

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

    Yes. `Rmd`.

### Correctness and efficiency of solution: 53/50

-   Q1 (25/25)

-   Q2 (28/25)
    -  (+3 pts) 

### Usage of Git: 9/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

    Yes.

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? (-1 pt) 

    7 commits for hw3. Make as many commits as possible during the process. 
    
    
- 	Is the hw3 submission tagged? 
 	
	Yes. 

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?

    Yes.

-   Do not put a lot auxillary files into version control.

    Yes.

### Reproducibility: 9/10

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? (-1 pt)

	- Provide absolute path for the data. ```ls -l NYParkingViolations.csv``` cannot be run since `NYParkingViolations.csv` is not in `hw3` directory. 

   
-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

    Yes.
